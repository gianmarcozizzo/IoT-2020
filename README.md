# IoT-2020
This project is part of an assignment for the course of Internet of Things at the Sapienza University of Rome.  The aim is to build a Virtual Environmental Station based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simulates some sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Rain Height, Wind Direction and Wind Intensity) generating random values from two different stations from a Python script and sending them to a database (DynamoDB) with an MQTT broker. Then these data will be shown on a simple web application (running in localhost for this project).
