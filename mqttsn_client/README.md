# About
The file needed to run the system is *bridge.py*\
The other files are utilities provided by [Mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto.rsmb) at *mosquitto.rsmb/rsmb/src/MQTTSClient/Python*, the same folder where *bridge.py* has to stay, as explained in my Hackster [guide](https://www.hackster.io/gianmarcozizzo/aws-based-iot-virtual-environmental-station-using-riot-os-1bd69d)
